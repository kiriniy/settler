# Settler

A blank PHP-based project template for not-quite-developers — when your future website is too complex for static HTML, but not complicated enough for a CMS and database.

If you're looking for **Lite** version: [https://github.com/kiriniy/settler-lite](https://github.com/kiriniy/settler-lite)

## Philosophy
At some point, we were overwhelmed by frameworks, building tools, and dependency trees. However, most websites don't need React, Node.js, Docker, Webpack, or 100 dependencies in json-configs to get the job done. Web development has become overly complicated due to the assumption that everyone needs the same tools as large corporations, even for a simple five-page website.

### For whom?
 - **Novice devs** who wants to learn PHP without getting lost in Laravel.
 - **Old-school devs** who still use `include()` as a design pattern.
 - **Small businesses** that just need a simple website, not a tech stack.
 - **Freelancers** who are looking for a way to quickly build client websites.
 - **Anyone** who wants to control every page and every line on it.

## Requirements
 - Local (MAMP, WAMP, XAMPP etc) or remote HTTP server with PHP.

### Optional
 - Code or Text editor.
 - JS bundler for js-source files.
 - SASS compiler for css-source files.
 - Graphic editor for icons, thumbnails etc.

### Minimal knowledge
